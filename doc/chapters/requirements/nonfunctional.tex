\begin{description}
	\item[Availability] The application must be always available, users need
		to connect from every location at any time.
	\item[Failure Tolerance] The application must handle failures in the
		network, preferring the availability over the consistency.  In
		fact the application core business is to simulate trading
		strategies on a large period of time, so even if some recent
		data is not consistently updated at any time it's preferable to
		keep serving the users instead of shutting down the service. 
	\item[Concurrency] The application must handle multiple clients
		concurrently connected.
	\item[Persistency] Data must be persistently stored by the application.
	\item[Security] The application must ensures that the user is logged in
		to use the service and that he/she has the right privileges to
		run the requested action.
