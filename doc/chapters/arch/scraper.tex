\section{Scraper}\label{sec:scraper}

The scraper is the program, run on a server, that downloads data from data
sources \exgratia{Binance, Coinbase, \etc} through the API that those sources
provide, and store the data in our database following the structure defined in
\secref{sec:collections}.

The scraper may receive a \code{SYNC} message from the server: this message
informs the scraper that he needs to reload the data from the database because
something has been changed \exgratia{the configuration of a source/market}.
