\section{Further improvements}\label{sec:future}

When a user logs-in with the server, an auth token is created and returned to
the client. From now on, the client resends this token with every request with
the server. This allows for the server to be \standout{stateless} \idest{it does
not need to maintain the user login informations on its memory: when a new
request arrive, it just checks again the database for the validity of the
token}.

With a stateless server, we can also distribute it on multiple servers in order
to ensure high availability of the application and better performance, since it
does not matter which server handles the request when it arrives from the
client.

We may choose to distribute the server program on multiple server machines with
\standout{Docker Swarm}. But since this decision does not impact with the
design, the architecture and the implementation of the application, we postpone
this decision to the future.
