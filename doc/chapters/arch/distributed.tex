\section{Replication and Sharding}\label{sec:distributed}
The application uses replicas to ensure high availability.

To ensure a good load balancing between cluster's servers the \code{Market\-Data}
collection is sharded, because it is the biggest one and it is often read when
running a strategy.

The \code{\_id} field is the shard key since it has a good granularity (so
\mongodb{} can split the documents into a large number of chunks). The field is
hash-indexed, thus the chunks will be randomly distributed across the configured
servers.
