\section{Client}\label{sec:client}

The client is the program run by the user. It just reads the input from the
user from which builds the requests for the server and send them out. When the
server responds, the client shows the results to the user and waits for new
input.

Only a terminal interface is provided: the user will issue commands by
navigating through menus and by filling forms.

If the user uploads (downloads) a strategy, the client will read (write) it from
(to) the file system.
