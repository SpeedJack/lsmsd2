\section{Run the client}\label{sec:clientrun}

The client supports the following parameters:

%TODO: complete help message in implementation
\begin{verbatim}
$ java -jar Client.jar --help
usage: app [-h | --help] [-H <HOSTLIST> | --hosts <HOSTLIST>]
 -h,--help               Print this message.
 -H,--hosts <HOSTLIST>   List of server hostname:port.
\end{verbatim}

To connect the client to the server application deployed on the machines of the
\theinstitute, connect to the institute's VPN and then run:

\begin{verbatim}
$ java -jar Client.jar
\end{verbatim}

If you want to connect to a different server (or a cluster of servers, if the
server application is deployed on multiple servers) run:

\begin{verbatim}
$ java -jar Client.jar
  -H <host>:<port>[,<alt-host>:<alt-port>,...]
\end{verbatim}

After that, you can log-in (the administrator must create the user for you):

\begin{verbatim}
Select an action:
1)      Log-In
0)      Exit

Enter number: 1

Please, log-in:

USERNAME: yourusername
PASSWORD: yourpassword
\end{verbatim}
