\section{Upload a new strategy}\label{sec:upload}

When you select the ``Upload a new strategy'' menu entry, the system will ask
you which file you want to upload. You can insert an absolute or relative path.
The file must exists and its name must end with \code{.java}.

\begin{verbatim}
Insert a strategy file to upload (the file must be .java):

File [strategy.java]: path/to/MyStrategy.java
\end{verbatim}

To develop a new strategy, see~\appendixref{appendix:devman}.

Various samples of strategies are available in the \code{strategies} folder.
