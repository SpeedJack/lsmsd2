This library handles the communication between the \code{Client} and the
\code{Server}. The \code{RequestMessage} class represents a request made by the
client, while the \code{ResponseMessage} class represents a response from the
server. Both classes contain a list of entities (Java classes) that contains the
data. The \code{RequestMessage} class also contains the auth token used for
authenticating the user.

The library serialize all messages in XML\@.
