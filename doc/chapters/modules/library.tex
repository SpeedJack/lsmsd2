\section{Strategy's library}\label{sec:library}

The \code{app.library} package, placed inside the \code{Server} project,
contains the library used by the strategy for the execution. It contains some
technical indicators and the \code{Journal} and \code{Trade} classes used to
register all the operations made by the strategy and to generate the final
report. It also contains the \code{Candle} class used to represent a candle with
technical analysis informations and the \code{ExecutableStrategy} interface that
every strategy must implement.

More informations on this library can be found in \appendixref{appendix:devman}.
