\chapter{Application setup}\label{appendix:setup}

\figref{fig:setup} shows the setup that we have made on the \theinstitute's
machines (not all connections between \code{mongos} and \code{mongod} instances
are shown). Client, Server and Scraper use this configuration by default.

\end{figure}

If using another configuration, each application has several command line
options to change the connection parameters. You can see all the available
parameters for an application by passing the \code{-h} (\code{--help}) option to
it.

The \code{-c} (\code{--connection-string}) option, available for server and
scraper, allows to change the connection string used to connect to \mongodb.
Here, an example with the default connection string:
\begin{verbatim}
$ java -jar Server.jar -c "mongodb://172.16.1.35:27017,
        172.16.1.39:27017,172.16.1.43:27017"
\end{verbatim}

If \mongodb{} is running as a single standalone instance, you need to pass the
\code{-s} (\code{--standalone}) option to the server and the scraper to disable
the sharding. In this case, server and scraper expect by default to find the
standalone \code{mongod} instance at \code{localhost:27017} (unless changed with
the \code{-c} option).

The server application expect to find the running scraper instance at
\code{172.16.1.35:5656}. If the scraper is running somewhere else, you can use
the server's \code{-H} (\code{--scraper-host}) and \code{-P}
(\code{--scraper-port}) options in order to override the default value.

The client's \code{-H} (\code{--hosts}) option can be used to set a different
(list of) server(s) to connect to. See \secref{sec:clientrun} for details.

On first start, the server will ask to create the administrator's account.
