\chapter{Specifications}

The application developed for this workgroup task is a tool for
\standout{automated testing of financial trading strategies}.

The application allows the user to define a strategy and the test it with the
historical price action data of various markets. The user can then visualize
statistics on the performance of the strategy.

% TODO: move the following out of this chapter. This chapter should only talk
% about the application purpose while this paragraph is about the system
% architecture.
The application is compound by three components:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item The scraper, which can be active or not, that uses online
		exchanges API to download market data and save it in a document
		database in a common structure, even if data comes from multiple
		sources;
	\item The server, which accepts requests from the client and runs the
		strategies over the data saved in the database, then it responds
		with the results;
	\item The client, \idest*{the front-end application used by the users to
		submit strategies to the server and get back the results}.
\end{enumerate*}

The \standout{User}, when logged-in, can write a new trading strategy using the
Java programming language: the user must create a Java class implementing a
method that receives in input the price action of the asset (the method is
called once for every \emph{trading day}\footnote{A trading day is a time span
for which the price action, during that time span, is aggregated into four
values: highest, lowest, opening (the price at the start of the day) and closing
(the price at the end of the day) prices.}, giving in input the highest, lowest,
opening and closing price for that day, and it must respond each time with a
buy/sell/do-nothing decision\footnote{More specifically, the strategy can open
multiple trades with different amounts and then close it at some time in the
future. A trade can be a long (buy) trade or a short (sell) trade. The close
operation, consist of making the inverse of the opening operation with the same
amount.}). Then, through the application, the user selects a market, the amount
to invest, the time interval of the trading day and others configurable
parameters for the selected strategy. After that, the application will apply the
defined strategy to all the historical data available for that market. At the
end, the application shows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The net profit or loss;
	\item The gross profit \idest{the sum of the profits from all winning
		trades} and the gross lost;
	\item The Buy and Hold return (for comparison purpose);
	\item The total number of trades concluded by the strategy;
	\item The remaining open trades at the end of evaluation;
	\item The average amount of money involved in trades;
	\item The average duration of a trade (in terms of trading days);
	\item The percent of winning (profitable) and losing trades;
	\item The maximum number of consecutive losing trades;
	\item A graph of the evolution of the invested amount during time;
	\item The maximum drawback \idest{the maximum distance between a peak
		and the subsequent lowest trough in the graph above}.
\end{itemize}

For the development of strategies, the application provides a library for easily
compute common statistics over market data \exgratia{moving averages, standard
deviations, common indicators like the Relative Strength Index, Moving Average
Convergence/Divergence, Bollinger Bands margins, \etc}.

The application allows the user to display assets in different sort order (top
gainers, top losers, largest volume, \etc).

The \standout{Administrator} can:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Add/remove users;
	\item Enable/disable data sources;
	\item Delete old or no-more-relevant data;
	\item Change various parameters for each data source \exgratia{API keys,
		data granularity, markets};
	\item Regenerate the data, re-downloading it from configured data
		sources;
	\item Enable/disable the download in streaming of new data;
	\item Enable/disable markets for selection by users;
	\item Set a rate-limit over the ability of users to test their
		strategies.
\end{itemize}

There's only one administrator. The administrator is created when the
application is run for the first time.
