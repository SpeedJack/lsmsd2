\section{Aggregation Pipelines}\label{sec:aggregations}

\begin{itemize}
	\item To obtain a larger granularity on the data present in a given
		market, when we apply a strategy, we can aggregate the
		\code{"data"} fields.
	\item To obtain the number of winning and losing trades we can aggregate
		the data present in the \code{"trades"} field of the report.
	\item Further aggregations can be found in the library functions,
		mentioned in \chref{ch:specs}, provided to the user to develop
		his/her strategy.
\end{itemize}
