\section{Indexes}\label{sec:indexes}

To ensure better performance of our application the following indexes are
defined:
\begin{description}
	\item[users: \{"auth\_tokens"."auth\_token":1\}] this index is useful
		when a request is performed by an user, the application must
		check if the provided auth\_token is present in the database.
	\item[marketdata: \{"market\_name":1,"month":1\}] this index is useful
		when the strategy is run. The application must retrieve the data
		in chronological order.
	\item[strategies:\{"run"."run\_config":1\}] this index can speed up the
		retrieval of the execution of a given "\code{run\_config}", in
		order to give to the user an immediate response, instead to run
		from scratch a strategy.
	\item[strategies:\{"runs"."report"."net\_profit":1\}] this index is used
		to order the strategies on their performances.
\end{description}
