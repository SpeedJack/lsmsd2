\section{Indexes}\label{sec:indexes}

To ensure better performance of the application, some indexes are defined for
each collection.

Note that, during the development of the application, some of the following
indexes may be changed, removed, or other indexes may be added. Those decisions
will be guided by performance evaluations of the application on common
workloads.

\subsection{Users}

We need to get a user by username (\code{\_id}) and \code{passwordHash}
when the user performs login. So, a compound index as the following can support
the query:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json]
{"_id": 1, "passwordHash": 1}
\end{lstlisting}

Moreover, this also support queries on the username only since the \code{\_id}
field is a prefix for the index (and this fields is also an unique index by
default).

\subsection{AuthTokens}

Auth tokens are always retrieved by the token hash, which is saved in the
\code{\_id} field that is already an unique index.

Additionally, the following \standout{TTL index} is defined:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json]
{"expireTime": 1}, {expireAfterSeconds: 0}
\end{lstlisting}

This will instruct \mongodb{} to automatically remove tokens when they expire.

\subsection{Sources}

We need to get a source, with all the markets, or a single market inside a
source. The following compound index can support both queries:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json]
{"_id": 1, "markets.id": 1}
\end{lstlisting}

We may use index intersection to fulfill the query that gets a single market,
but since there is no need to get all the markets with a specific id from all
sources (we always get a specific market in a specific source), we prefer to
define a compound index in order to save \mongodb{} the need to access two indexes
to perform the query.

\subsection{MarketData}

We need to get market data by \code{\_id} during the execution of a strategy. In
fact, when a strategy is run, the user specifies the source name, the market
name and the application will start pulling data from the database
month-by-month, so there are all elements to fully build the \code{\_id} field.
The \code{\_id} field is already indexed, but we will define an \standout{hashed
index} on it:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json]
{_id: "hashed"}
\end{lstlisting}

This is an hashed index since it will also be used as a shard key to shard the
collection over multiple servers, as defined in \secref{sec:distributed}.

\subsection{Strategies}

Strategies are retrieved by file hash (the \code{\_id} field, already indexed)
or by name. Thus, we define the following \standout{unique index}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json]
{"name": 1}, {unique: true}
\end{lstlisting}

Since we also need to check if a strategy has been already run with a specific
configuration \idest{a configuration with the same hash}, we also define the
following:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json]
{"run.config.hash": 1}
\end{lstlisting}

We can leverage the \mongodb's index intersection feature in order to support
queries that specifies the \code{name} or the \code{\_id} of a strategy and the
\code{hash} of the configuration.

To allow the application to rapidly sort strategies by the net profit (commonly
used to represent the overall performance of a strategy), we define the
following index:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json]
{"run.report.netProfit": 1}
\end{lstlisting}
