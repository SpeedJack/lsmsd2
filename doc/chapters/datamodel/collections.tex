\section{Collections}\label{sec:collections}

In this section we will define the database structure. The following collections
are defined:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=]
	\item \code{Users};
	\item \code{AuthTokens};
	\item \code{Sources};
	\item \code{MarketData};
	\item \code{Strategies}.
\end{enumerate*}

Small changes may be made in future to the structure and the content of each
collection in order to ensure better performance or a simpler implementation of
the application.

\subsection{Users}

Each document represents a user.

\lstinputlisting[language=json, label={lst:userscollection},
caption={\code{Users} collection example.}]{users.json}

Fields' description:
\begin{description}
	\item[\_id] \textit{(string)} Username;
	\item[passwordHash] \textit{(string)} Password hash;
	\item[isAdmin] \textit{(boolean, optional)} Specifies whether the user
		is the administrator or not. If not present, is considered
		\code{false};
\end{description}

\subsection{AuthTokens}

Each document represents an authorization token used to authenticate the user
with the server. Multiple clients can connect as the same user creating a
session (a token) for each client (this allows for a session management feature
to be implemented in future).

\lstinputlisting[language=json, label={lst:authtokenscollection},
caption={\code{AuthTokens} collection example.}]{authtokens.json}

Fields' description:
\begin{description}
	\item[\_id] \textit{(string)} Token hash (generated randomly);
	\item[username] \textit{(string)} User's username;
	\item[isAdmin] \textit{(boolean, optional)} Specifies whether the user
		is the administrator or not; if not present, is considered
		\code{false};
	\item[expireTime] \textit{(ISODate)} Token expire time.
\end{description}

\subsection{Sources}

Each document represents a data source.

\lstinputlisting[language=json, label={lst:sourcescollection},
caption={\code{Sources} collection example.}]{sources.json}

Fields' description:
\begin{description}
	\item[\_id] \textit{(string)} Source name;
	\item[enabled] \textit{(boolean, optional)} Specifies if the market is
		enabled or not. If not present, is considered \code{false};
	\item[markets] \textit{(array, optional)} array of embedded documents
		that lists the market available for this source. The structure
		of these documents is the following:
		\begin{description}
			\item[id] \textit{(string)} Name of the market;
			\item[baseCurrency] \textit{(string)} Name of the quoted
				currency;
			\item[quoteCurrency] \textit{(string)} Name of the
				quoting currency;
			\item[granularity] \textit{(integer)} Minimum size,
				in minutes, of a candle;
			\item[selectable] \textit{(boolean, optional)} Specifies
				if users are allowed or not to test strategies
				on this market. If not present, is considered
				\code{false}. If \code{enabled} is \code{false},
				this is considered \code{false};
			\item[sync] \textit{(boolean, optional)} Specifies if
				the scraper should synchronize the data for this
				market with the data that it downloads from the
				source. If not present, is considered
				\code{false}. If \code{enabled} is \code{false},
				this is considered \code{false};
			\item[filled] \textit{(boolean, optional)} Specifies if
				the scraper has finished the download of old
				data for this market or not. This field is
				necessary only for some data sources
				\exgratia{Coinbase} that does not offer the
				possibility to determine which is the first time
				for which data is available and so data must be
				downloaded in reversed order (from most recent
				data to older data). If not present, means that
				it is not necessary and so it is not
				used\footnote{Note that we may decide, in order
					to simplify the development of the
					scraper, that the data from \emph{all}
					sources will be downloaded in reversed
					order. In such case, the \code{filled}
					field will be used for all markets saved
					in the database.}.
		\end{description}
\end{description}

\subsection{MarketData}

Market data is divided into multiple documents, where each document represents a
month of data.

\lstinputlisting[language=json, label={lst:marketdatacollection},
caption={\code{MarketData} collection example.}]{marketdata.json}

Fields' description:
\begin{description}
	\item[\_id] \textit{(string)} Format:
		\code{sourcename:marketname:YYYY-MM};
	\item[data] \textit{(array)} Array of embedded documents where each
		document represent a trading day (candle). The structure of
		these documents is the following:
		\begin{description}
			\item[t] \textit{(ISODate)} The opening time of the
				day;
			\item[o] \textit{(numeric)} The opening price of the
				day;
			\item[h] \textit{(numeric)} The highest price of the
				day;
			\item[l] \textit{(numeric)} The lowest price of the day;
			\item[c] \textit{(numeric)} The closing price of the
				day;
			\item[v] \textit{(numeric)} The volume, \idest*{the
				amount traded during the day}.
		\end{description}
\end{description}

The \code{data} array is pre-filled with all candles that should be part of the
month (even if not all candles are available). This improves performance when
the scraper downloads the data from the source since it's a mutable document
that otherwise it will need to be frequently re-allocated.

\subsection{Strategies}

Each document represents a strategy.

\lstinputlisting[language=json, label={lst:strategiescollection},
caption={\code{Strategies} collection example.}]{strategies.json}

Fields' description:
\begin{description}
	\item[\_id] \textit{(string)} Hash of the file that defines the
		strategy;
	\item[name] \textit{(string)} Name of the strategy;
	\item[author] \textit{(string)} Username of the user that submitted the
		strategy;
	\item[runs] \textit{(array, optional)} Array of embedded documents that
		list all the tests made by the users with this strategy. The
		structure of these documents is the following:
		\begin{description}
			\item[id] \textit{(ObjectId)} An unique id of the run;
			\item[user] \textit{(string)} The user who launched the
				run;
			\item[config] \textit{(document)} Strategy's
				configuration used:
				\begin{description}
					\item[market] \textit{(string)} Name of
						the market on which the strategy
						has been executed. Format:
						\code{sourcename:marketname};
					\item[inverseCross] \textit{(boolean,
						optional)} Specifies if the
						strategy has run on the inverse
						market cross for the selected
						market or not. If not present,
						is considered \code{false};
					\item[granularity] \textit{(integer)}
						Size of candles passed to the
						strategy (this value should be a
						multiple of the minimum
						granularity of data available);
					\item[startTime]
						\textit{(ISODate)} Time of the
						first data on which the strategy
						has been executed;
					\item[endTime]
						\textit{(ISODate)} Time of the
						last data on which the strategy
						has been executed;
					\item[\ldots] Other fields may be
						present (defined by the
						strategy).
				\end{description}
			\item[report] \textit{(document)} Report generated by
				the execution of the strategy:
				\begin{description}
					\item[netProfit] \textit{(numeric)} The
						profit (\(\interval[open
						right]{0}{+\infty}\)) or loss
						(\(\interval[open
						right]{-1}{0}\)) of the
						strategy, computed as the total
						profit minus the total loss of
						the trades (percentage of the
						initial amount);
					\item[grossProfit] \textit{(numeric)}
						The gross profit, computed as
						the total profits of all winning
						trades;
					\item[grossLoss] \textit{(numeric)} The
						gross loss, computed as the
						total losses of all losing
						trades;
					\item[hodlProfit] \textit{(numeric)} The
						profit (\(\interval[open
						right]{0}{+\infty}\)) or loss
						(\(\interval[open
						right]{-1}{0}\)) of the Buy and
						Hold strategy (percentage of the
						initial amount);
					\item[totalTrades] \textit{(integer)}
						The total number of trades;
					\item[openTrades] \textit{(integer)} The
						number of uncompleted trades;
					\item[winningTrades] \textit{(integer)}
						The number of winning trades;
					\item[maxConsecutiveLosing]
						\textit{(integer)} The maximum
						number of consecutive losing
						trades;
					\item[avgAmount] \textit{(numeric)} The
						average amount of money involved
						in trades (percentage of the
						initial amount);
					\item[avgDuration] \textit{(numeric)}
						The average duration, in terms
						of trading days, of a trade;
					\item[maxDrawdown] \textit{(numeric)}
						The maximum drawdown as defined
						in \chref{ch:specs}. This is
						expressed as a percentage of the
						initial amount;
				\end{description}
		\end{description}
\end{description}

Note that all amounts specified are expressed as a percentage of the initial
amount. This means that when a strategy opens a trade, it will specify a
percentage of the total invested amount. This allows the users to change the
initial amount for a strategy and view the report without the need to rerun the
strategy.
